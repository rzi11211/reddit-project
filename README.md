### "Should I post this to r/books or r/writing?"

An [online NLP classification app](http://bit.ly/reddit-project) built and deployed with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). 

This app uses a model based on a Logistic Regression classification and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency transformer to classify text submissions as more appropriate for the **r/books** subreddit vs the **r/writing** subreddit. 

Learn more about the model in [the presentation.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14QqcgZnQoDOAsfxOTHvzoNpQ6SRuaYRRejqTdo0tPjw/edit?usp=sharing)
